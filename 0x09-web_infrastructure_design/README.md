## Files.

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0. Simple web stack` | Design a one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via www.foobar.com with 1 server, 1 web server (Nginx), 1 application server, 1 application files (your code base), 1 database (MySQL), 1 domain name foobar.com configured with a www record that points to your server IP 8.8.8.8 |
| `1. Distributed web infrastructure` | Design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com with 2 servers, 1 web server (Nginx), 1 application server, 1 load-balancer (HAproxy), set of application files (your code base), 1 database (MySQL).|
| `2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure` | Design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored with 3 firewalls 1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS 3 monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services). |
| `3. Scale up` | Based on 2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure, design a web infraestructure that contains some aditional important elements, 1 server, 1 load-balancer (HAproxy)configured as cluster with the other one Split components (web server, application server, database) with their own server. |
